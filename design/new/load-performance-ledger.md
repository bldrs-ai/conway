# Load performance ledger: what the M3 work cost, what it bought, and where the wall moved

Companion to [parallel-load-pipeline.md](parallel-load-pipeline.md), which asks
whether O(cores) is reachable and answers it from Node measurements. This doc
asks a different question — **was the complexity worth it, and what should be
built next** — and answers it from the first production load of D3D on the
shipped engine.

Its conclusion is not the one the roadmap assumed: on a real IFC4 model in a
real browser, **geometry is 90 % of the load and parse is 8 %**, so the parse
work that dominated M2/M7/M8 is worth at most 9 % no matter how many cores it
gets. And the binding constraint for the models users are actually bringing is
no longer time at all — it is **peak heap, currently 9.8× file size**.


## 0. The measurement

First production D3D load with the shipped wins. Share `v1.1772.e431cbd`,
conway `v1.1565.608-g18366f01`, uploaded file served from the OPFS cache.

| phase | time | % of load | heap Δ | % of growth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Preparing file | 0.056 s | 0.05 % | 12.5 MB | 0.6 % |
| Hashing model | 0.395 s | 0.34 % | 210.1 MB | 10.4 % |
| Opening model | 0.049 s | 0.04 % | 0.0 MB | 0.0 % |
| **Parsing** | **9.639 s** | **8.28 %** | 778.2 MB | 38.4 % |
| **Geometry** | **104.683 s** | **89.92 %** | 1002.6 MB | 49.4 % |
| Assembling render mesh | 1.602 s | 1.38 % | 25.7 MB | 1.3 % |
| **Total** | **116.424 s** | | 67.9 → **2097.1 MB** | |

Model: 213.6 MB IFC4 (Tekla export), 3,204,852 vertices, 2,453,022 triangles,
units mm. Geometry window held at 197.6 MB.

**Read §5 before reusing this table.** The heap column is
`performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize`, which is frozen for twenty minutes at a
time in any Chrome not launched with `--enable-precise-memory-info`. It is
wasm-inclusive, so 2,097 MB is a real JS + wasm total and 9.82x is not an
undercount — but a run without that flag prints `+0.000000 MB heap` on every
line, so this table cannot be reproduced by simply loading the model again.

**The before number is reported, not measured.** Prior behaviour on this model
is recalled as *"700 s+ and something like 6–7 GB"*. Treat it as an order of
magnitude — roughly 6× the time and 3× the peak — not as a baseline. If the
comparison matters for anything load-bearing, re-measure it against a pinned
older conway rather than citing this line.

The bulk of that win is **#616/#617** (adaptive residency in the windowed
pager), which took D3D's aggregate read amplification from 220.9× to 5.1× —
measured in Node at 225.8 s → 75.4 s. Everything else in the M3 batch was
either correctness or an enabler that nothing yet calls.


## 1. The ledger

What the four PRs of the M3 batch cost, and what they return. "Shipped" means a
user sees it today; "enabled" means it is a precondition for something not yet
built.

| change | added (incl. tests/docs) | shipped gain | enabled gain |
|---|---:|---|---|
| #617 adaptive residency | ~100 | **D3D 225.8 s → 75.4 s (Node)** | — |
| #623 v2 sidecar + open-from-index | ~2,700 | 0 — plus a real correctness fix | 16.7× (PSB) / 19.4× (D3D) per *additional* consumer |
| #624 sharded index build | ~3,400 | 0 — no production caller by design | 3.26× on the parse phase, N=4 |
| #622 + #629 | ~1,500 | 0 — correctness | — |

Roughly 7,700 added lines for one shipped speedup, and that speedup came from
the smallest change in the set.

**The pattern in the repo's own data is that waste-elimination beat parallelism
on every axis measured.** #617 got its 3× by not re-reading the same bytes 220
times. #541's 16–19× is the same shape: N workers not re-parsing one file.
Sharding got 3.26× on one phase for 1,175 lines of builder plus a transport
that needed five review rounds and was ultimately demoted to bench code
(see #631).

Two entries deserve their qualifier stated rather than assumed:

- **#623's correctness fix is not incidental.** The v1 sidecar carried only
  `[0, firstInlineElement)`, so a model restored from one resolved every inline
  entity to `null` — surface styles, transparency and measure-valued attributes
  degrading silently on a model that still loaded and looked approximately
  right. Inline share ranges from 0.274 % (MB-Khaya) to 20.995 % (D3D), a 77×
  spread, so whether v1 was safe depended on the exporter. That fix would
  justify a good part of the diff on its own.
- **#624 is speculative inventory.** Its value is entirely contingent on a
  worker pool that does not exist. The shipped artifact — builder plus a merge
  proven byte-identical — has a production caller of exactly zero, and its
  default runner (`inProcessShardRunner`) is sequential with no lifecycle at
  all.


## 2. The production shape retires the parse-first plan for D3D-shaped models

[parallel-load-pipeline.md §8.6](parallel-load-pipeline.md) already computed
that parse parallelism on D3D yields **1.03×** overall. Production says
**1.061×** at the measured 3.26× shard efficiency. The doc was right, and
slightly conservative.

The arithmetic, from the table in §0:

```
parse is 8.28 % of the load
  → Amdahl cap for parallelising parse alone      1.090x   (infinite cores)
  → at the measured 3.26x (N=4)                   1.061x   (116.4 s → 109.7 s)
                                                           5.7 % of wall clock
```

So **M2 buys under six percent on this workload**, and cannot buy more than
nine even in the limit. That is not an argument that M2 was wrong — PSB is a
different shape, and the seam it defines is reusable — but it does mean the
parse phase is finished as a target. Further parse work should be justified by
a model whose profile is not D3D's.

Geometry is where the load is:

```
geometry is 89.92 % of the load
  → Amdahl cap for parallelising geometry alone   9.92x
```

**These projections are unmeasured.** Geometry parallel efficiency has never
been measured in this repo. The figures below assume it, and the assumption is
doing real work in the conclusion:

| configuration | assumed efficiency | geometry | total | speedup |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| geometry N=4 | 0.80 | 32.7 s | 44.5 s | 2.62× |
| geometry N=8 | 0.65 | 20.1 s | 31.9 s | 3.65× |
| geometry N=4 + parse N=4 | 0.80 / 0.857 | — | 37.8 s | **3.08×** |

The efficiency numbers are borrowed from the *parse* measurements, and there is
a reason to think they transfer badly in either direction. Parse sharding
degraded from 0.94 at N=2 to 0.857 at N=4 while a register-bound spin loop held
0.97 — that is a memory-bandwidth signature. Geometry is tessellation:
compute-heavy, working-set-small, and plausibly a *better* scaler. Or worse, if
the wasm heap is the shared resource. **Measure it before planning against it.**


## 3. The wall moved, and it is memory

Peak heap on this load was **2,097 MB for a 213.6 MB file — 9.82×**.

Users are now bringing 2 GB and 3 GB models. At the current amplification:

| model | projected peak |
|---|---:|
| 2 GB | ~19.6 GB |
| 3 GB | ~29.5 GB |

Neither loads. This is not a "slow" outcome, it is a hard failure, and it is
reached long before wall-clock becomes the complaint. **For the large-model
positioning, the amplification factor — not the load time — is the constraint
that decides which files open at all.**

To fit a 2 GB model inside a 4 GB budget, amplification must come down to
**≤ 2×**, a **4.9× reduction** from where it is.

Where the bytes are, from the same load:

| phase | heap Δ | what it is | lever |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Geometry | 1002.6 MB | 49 % of growth. Final mesh is only ~106–132 MB¹, so this is **7.6–9.4× the output** in transient | the largest and least understood term — needs profiling before design |
| Parsing | 778.2 MB | 38 % of growth, for a 213.6 MB file | index + materialised entities; the columnar index is already compact, so this is likely entity objects |
| Hashing | 210.1 MB | 10 % of growth — the file materialised solely to digest it | ~~#623's `HashingByteSource`~~ — **wrong lever, see §7**: this stage is Share's GLB cache-key SHA-1, not conway's sidecar digest |
| Mesh assembly | 25.7 MB | 1 % | — |

¹ Estimated as `vertices × (24–32 B) + triangles × 12 B` for f32
position+normal(+uv) and u32 indices. If the real vertex format is fatter this
ratio shrinks; it does not change the conclusion that the transient dominates.
(§7 replaces the estimate with the actual layouts: 132.0 MB merged,
106.3 MB batched — and notes that both are held *twice* on the JS side.)

The geometry **window** was held at 197.6 MB throughout, so streaming residency
is working as designed. The 1 GB is not the window — it is output plus
transient, and it is the single biggest item on the page.


## 4. What this implies for sequencing

1. **Measure geometry's memory profile before building geometry parallelism.**
   A worker pool that runs N geometry shards concurrently multiplies whichever
   part of that 1 GB is per-shard transient. Parallelising into a memory wall
   makes the 2 GB case worse, not better. This is the one measurement that
   should gate the next design.
2. ~~**Wire `HashingByteSource`.**~~ **Retracted — see §7.** It is a
   different digest on a different code path, it is not on `main`, and it
   would not remove a byte of the `Hashing model` stage. The replacement
   items, in the order §7 and §8 put them: fix the instrument
   (`--enable-precise-memory-info`, one line in `tools/playwright.config.js`),
   take a heap snapshot of the 1,233 MB of V8 objects §8 found, and extend
   AFTP's arena scopes to the IFC tessellation entry points, which today
   record zero scoped faces on D3D-shaped models.
3. **Geometry before parse, for anything D3D-shaped.** 89.92 % versus 8.28 %.
4. **Keep hunting waste.** #617 returned 3× for ~100 lines; #547 (retry-first
   starvation) is filed and still unmeasured; the browser measurement harness
   built for this batch has been used once. On the evidence in §1, one more
   profiling pass has a better expected return than another thousand lines of
   parallel machinery.
5. **Do not land #624 without a scheduled consumer**, or accept it as inventory
   with a carrying cost. The `ShardRunner` seam is the durable asset and it is
   small; the builder is 1,175 lines of proof-carrying merge that nothing calls.


## 5. What the instrument actually measures

**Before reading §0 or §3 again, know this: the heap column in a load report
is blank in every browser that is not launched with a debug flag, and the
numbers in §0 could only have come from a run that was.**

The column is `performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize`, sampled twice over —
Share's `usedHeapMb()` (`src/loader/loadProgress.js`) for legacy string
stages, conway's `Memory.usedHeapMb()` (`src/memory/memory.ts`) for engine
`ProgressEvent`s. Two properties of it were measured on the shipped build
(Chromium 141.0.7390.37 (Playwright 1194), conway 1.588.1550, Share 1.1773):

1. **It DOES include WebAssembly linear memory.** Growing and touching a
   512 MiB `WebAssembly.Memory` moves `usedJSHeapSize` by 511.65 MB; so does
   a 512 MiB plain `ArrayBuffer`; so do 512 MiB of ordinary JS objects. It
   is V8's used heap **plus external memory**, and wasm memory is external
   memory. (This is the opposite of the Node side, where
   `heapUsed + external` is structurally blind to the wasm heap — the
   contrast is already documented in `src/memory/memory.ts` and
   `src/ifc/ifc_regression_main.ts`. Do not carry a Node intuition across.)
2. **It is frozen unless Chrome is launched with
   `--enable-precise-memory-info`.** Sampled every 5 s for 113 s while
   3.6 GB of wasm memory was committed in 200 MB steps, it returned
   **202.18 MB at every single sample** — the value latched at the first
   read and never moved again. `crossOriginIsolated` does not change this;
   only the flag does. (Blink rate-limits and bucketizes the default
   precision deliberately, as a side-channel defence; the *duration* of the
   latch was not measured here, only that it outlasts any load. Since a
   report is emitted from a single document, one latch covers the whole
   load.)

Both halves were confirmed end to end by loading the same model twice on the
same build, changing nothing but that flag:

| launch | the report Share printed |
|---|---|
| default | `Total: 5.403s, 9.536743 → 9.536743 MB heap`, and **every stage line `+0.000000 MB heap`** |
| `--enable-precise-memory-info` | `Total: 5.186s, 54.410274 → 133.049745 MB heap`, stages populated (`Geometry: +39.269753 MB`) |

**Consequences.**

- **The §0 table is a wasm-inclusive measurement** — so 2,097 MB is a real
  total for JS + wasm together, and 9.82× is not an undercount. That much of
  the ledger stands.
- **It was taken with the flag on** (or on something other than a stock
  browser). Nothing else can produce non-zero per-stage deltas inside a
  116 s load. Whoever reproduces §0 must set the same flag or they will get
  a page of zeros and read it as "no growth".
- **The shipped report's heap column is misinformation for every real
  user.** `+0.000000 MB heap` is not "this stage allocated nothing", it is
  "this browser will not tell me" — and it is printed with six decimal
  places of false precision on every load. Two cheap fixes, neither
  attempted here: have `usedHeapMb()` detect the frozen sampler (two reads
  either side of a known allocation) and omit the column, and add
  `--enable-precise-memory-info` to `tools/playwright.config.js` so the
  measurement harness gets real numbers by default.
- Note also what `usedJSHeapSize` is *not*: a live set. It counts
  unreclaimed garbage until a GC runs, exactly as `heapUsedMb` does in the
  Node regression columns (`ifc_regression_main.ts` documents SKYLARK250 at
  2547 MB instant against 981 MB after two forced collections). A per-stage
  delta in this column is "bytes allocated and not yet collected during that
  stage", not "bytes the stage needs".


## 6. The ceiling is 4 GiB, and it is hard

Read straight out of the shipped binary rather than the build scripts, because
the build scripts are not the artifact:

| build | memory | 64-bit? | initial | maximum |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ConwayGeomWasmWeb` (single-thread, `SINGLE_FILE`) | defined in-module | **no** | 256 pages / 16 MiB | **65 536 pages / 4096 MiB** |
| `ConwayGeomWasmWebMT` | imported `a.a`, `shared` | **no** | 256 pages / 16 MiB | **65 536 pages / 4096 MiB** |

`genie.lua` carries `-s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 -sGROWABLE_ARRAYBUFFERS=0
-s MAXIMUM_MEMORY=4GB` on every target and `-sMEMORY64` on none. So:

- **The wasm heap can never exceed 4 GiB on any machine**, and in practice
  4 GiB − 64 KiB: emscripten's own failure text from the mimalloc spike
  (`emsdk-upgrade-scalable-allocator.md`) reads *"requested 4294962208 bytes,
  but the limit is 4294901760 bytes"*, i.e. 65 535 pages. A full 65 536-page
  memory could not be viewed anyway — `new Int8Array(buffer)` over a
  4 GiB buffer exceeds V8's maximum typed-array length, and
  `updateMemoryViews()` builds ten such views on every growth.
- **The JS heap has its own, separate ~4 GB cap.** `jsHeapSizeLimit` reads
  4095.8 MB on this build. A load must fit under *both*, not under their sum.
- `WebAssembly.Memory` only grows. Once geometry has driven the heap up, the
  pages stay committed for the tab's lifetime; no `free()` inside wasm
  returns them. Peak, not retention, is the number that decides whether a
  model opens — which is why `wasmHeapByteLength` is used as a high-water
  reading in the Node regression columns with nothing to sample.

Production is on the **single-threaded** build, not the MT one:
`netlify.toml` deliberately omits COEP (the Google Picker sends
`CORP: same-site`), so `crossOriginIsolated` is false, so
`pThreadsAllowed()` returns false and `conway_geometry.ts` imports
`ConwayGeomWasmWeb.js`. Everything in this doc about wasm memory is about
that build; the MT one is not what users run.


## 7. Corrections to §3's lever table

Four of §3's claims say something different once the code behind them is
read — including the one §4 nominated as the cheapest item on the page.

**"Hashing — already solved but unwired: #623's `HashingByteSource`" is
wrong on every clause.** The 210 MB stage is Share's, not conway's: `Loader.js`
prints `Hashing model...` around `sha1HexFromBlob` (`src/utils/contentHash.js`),
which computes the **GLB cache key** — a chained fold of per-slice SHA-1s over
8 MiB slices, deliberately never materialising the file. `HashingByteSource`
is conway's FNV-1a **sidecar trust gate** on the open-from-index path, it
lives on branch `claude/issue-541-open-from-index` and is not on `main`, and
wiring it would not delete a byte of this stage, because this stage is not
computing that digest. What the 210 MB actually is: 213.6 MB / 8 MiB ≈ 26.7
per-slice `incoming` ArrayBuffers, allocated one per iteration and dropped,
with a `setTimeout(0)` yield only every 8th slice. The number matches the file
size to within 2 %, which is what an un-collected allocation-per-slice looks
like — it is garbage, not live data, and the lever is GC pressure (yield every
slice, or read into the existing `scratch` without the intermediate
`arrayBuffer()`), not a different hash. **Unmeasured**: nobody has confirmed
the garbage reading by forcing a collection at that stage boundary, and §8's
finding that the *end-of-load* peak is live does not settle a mid-load stage.

**"Geometry … the largest and least understood term — needs profiling before
design" understates what is already known and already shipped.** Two things
are already in the tree and bear directly on it:

- **The geometry store is already budgeted, and the budget is not where the
  gigabyte is.** Share passes `GEOMETRY_BUDGET_MB: 64` on the demand path
  (`conwayDirectIfcLoader.js`), and `demandGeometry` is `isActive: true`, so
  the production load in §0 ran with conway's LRU residency capping the
  **live** wasm-side geometry set at 64 MB. `geometry_residency.ts` measured
  that cap taking PSB's wasm peak from 1284 MB to 298 MB, and D3D under the
  same 64 MB rebuilding 2.8 % more assets in the same wall clock. So the
  1,002 MB is allocator high-water over a 64 MB live set, plus the JS-side
  copies — not a runaway cache.
- **The multiple over the live set is the documented signature, and the fix
  for it does not cover D3D.** `geometry_residency.ts` records an 8 MB live
  set under an 85 MB heap on MB-Khaya (10.6×); the AFTP telemetry in
  `emsdk-upgrade-scalable-allocator.md` records Arty_Z7 at ~75 MB retained
  under a 4.5 GB peak (60×), and names the two mechanisms — realloc-growth
  transients on mesh accumulation buffers, and ~218 M per-face
  malloc/free pairs. The arena that fixed it is scoped to
  `AddFaceToGeometry`, i.e. the **STEP / IFC advanced-BREP** path; the same
  telemetry pass records **zero scoped faces** on ordinary
  extrusion/profile/CSG IFC models. D3D is a Tekla IFC4 export of exactly
  that kind. **The shipped transient-memory fix does not run on D3D's
  tessellation path at all**, and extending its scopes to the IFC entry
  points is the single largest identified lever on this page.

**Two JS-side copies of the same geometry are live at peak.**
`incrementalBatchedBuilder.js` keeps a `geometryCache` entry — a full
`BufferGeometry` per unique geometry — for the life of the load, *and*
appends the same vertices and indices into the `BatchedMesh`'s packed
buffers, which three.js grows by doubling in place (so a growth event
transiently holds old + new). Clearing `geometryCache` at `finalize()`, or
evicting entries once every instance referencing them is placed, is a small
change with a bounded, arithmetically checkable saving.

**§3's footnote 1 can be replaced with the real vertex format.** The merged
path writes position + normal + `expressID` + `instanceID` = 32 B/vertex and
4 B/index, so D3D's 3,204,852 vertices / 2,453,022 triangles are 102.6 MB +
29.4 MB = **132.0 MB**, the top of the estimated range. The batched path
drops the two per-vertex u32s to 24 B/vertex → 106.3 MB. Both were guesses in
§3 and both are now exact.

**§3's "the geometry window (197.6 MB) is working as designed" deserves its
consequence spelled out.** By `memory-residency.md` §4, #616's adaptive
residency ends a D3D load holding **the whole 213.6 MB source** (64 MB →
213 MB, "whole file"), because D3D's rel-aggregate closure spans 52 of 54
chunks. The 3× speed-up in §1 was bought with roughly +150 MB of permanent
residency. That is a defensible trade at 2 GB total; at a 2 GB *model* it is
the first thing that has to become a policy rather than a constant.


## 8. Where the bytes are: JS versus wasm, measured

A full D3D load was re-run in Chromium with the flag on, with the wasm
memories instrumented (`WebAssembly.Memory` / `instantiate` wrapped at
document start), CDP `Runtime.getHeapUsage` for the V8 heap alone, and
renderer RSS from `/proc`. **This box is not §0's machine and the numbers are
not comparable to §0's line for line** — geometry took 4,256 s here against
104.7 s there, and the model was fetched over HTTP and materialised
(`Download: +207.8 MB`) rather than served from the OPFS cache. What
transfers is the *composition*, which nothing in §0 could see.

The report this run printed:

```
Share v1.1773.9a7c323, 57.446417 MB heap before load
Downloading model data:   0.704s,    +2.098222 MB heap
Download:                18.471s,  +207.832649 MB heap
Opening model:            0.210s,   +22.294870 MB heap
Parsing:                 21.069s,  +320.964076 MB heap
Geometry:              4256.060s, +1988.961535 MB heap
Assembling render mesh:   1.789s,   +50.995492 MB heap
Total:                 4298.303s, 54.68 -> 2647.83 MB | vertices=3204852 triangles=2453022 units=mm
```

and what that 2,648 MB is actually made of, sampled three times over 60 s
after the load settled and after two forced `HeapProfiler.collectGarbage`:

| component | MB | share | how read |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| V8 JS heap (objects) | **1,233** | 47 % | CDP `Runtime.getHeapUsage().usedSize` |
| External, non-wasm (ArrayBuffers) | **796** | 30 % | `usedJSHeapSize` − V8 − wasm |
| **wasm linear memory** | **611** | **23 %** | `buffer.byteLength`, both memories |
| = `performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize` | 2,640 | | |
| renderer RSS at that moment | 2,935 | | `/proc`, out of band |
| renderer RSS high-water seen | 3,574 | | same |

**Three things follow, and two of them cut against the ledger's working
assumptions.**

1. **This is not primarily a wasm problem.** Linear memory is 23 % of the
   total (2,648 MB against a 213.6 MB file is 12.4x here, against §0's
   9.82x). The hypothesis "the transient is wasm-side, therefore
   unreclaimable, therefore the only fix is high-water reduction" is *false
   for the bulk of it*: 77 % sits in the V8 heap and in ArrayBuffers, which
   the browser **can** hand back once the references go — unlike wasm pages,
   which it cannot (§6). The grow-only property is real and it does bind that
   611 MB; a fix aimed only there addresses under a quarter of the peak.
2. **The peak is live, not garbage.** Two forced full collections moved
   `usedJSHeapSize` by 7.6 MB out of 2,648. Whatever this is, it is
   *retained* through the end of the load, so "release it sooner" is a design
   change, not a GC-tuning one. (The 3,574 MB RSS high-water against a
   2,935 MB settled RSS says there is also a ~640 MB genuinely transient
   spike, and it lands after the `Total` line — in assembly / GLB export, not
   in geometry.)
3. **1,233 MB of V8 *objects* is the largest single item on the page, and
   it has never been attributed on the browser side.** Not ArrayBuffers —
   on-heap objects. conway #372 cut the parse index from ~1 GB to ~24 MB
   post-`invalidate` on a 7.8 M-entity model, so whatever this is, it is
   probably not that. Only a heap snapshot will say, and taking one is the
   obvious next move; the candidates visible in the code are
   `conwayDirectIfcLoader`'s `captured` array (every `FlatMesh` for the whole
   model, held for the whole load), conway's per-entity descriptor cache, and
   three.js's per-instance bookkeeping.

**Unmeasured, and it is the piece I most wanted:** the split *within* the
geometry stage. The in-page sampler took 21 samples during the 19 s download
and then **nothing at all for the next 72 minutes** — `page.evaluate` needs
the main thread, and the demand pump's `yieldToEventLoop()` between batches
never gave it up. Note the harness consequence: *any* in-page probe is blind
for the whole of geometry on a model this size, and the `/proc` reads were
blind too because they sat in the same loop. A per-phase memory profile needs
its RSS sampler in a process the page cannot starve, and its in-page reads
piggy-backed on conway's own progress callback rather than injected from
outside.


## 9. Still open

- **What is the 1,233 MB of V8 heap objects?** The single largest item in
  §8 and completely unexamined. One `HeapProfiler.takeHeapSnapshot` on a
  settled load answers it, and until it is answered no geometry-memory
  design should be committed to.
- **What is the split inside the geometry stage?** §8 says what the load ends
  holding; it does not say what geometry itself added, because the sampler
  was starved (see §8's last paragraph). Fixing the harness — out-of-band RSS
  sampling, in-page reads riding conway's progress callback — is a
  prerequisite for the next attempt.
- **Does parse's 778 MB scale with file size or with entity count?** Still
  unmeasured. D3D is 20.995 % inline entities, the highest in the corpus;
  PSB is 0.594 % and four times the size — comparing the two separates the
  terms, and the run in §8 is one env var away from PSB.
- **Does geometry parallelise better or worse than parse?** Still unmeasured,
  and §2's whole projection rests on it — but §6 adds a constraint the
  projection did not have: N geometry workers on the MT build share **one**
  4 GiB linear memory, so per-shard transient multiplies inside a fixed
  ceiling. Production is on the single-threaded build anyway
  (`crossOriginIsolated === false`), so shipping geometry parallelism means
  shipping COEP first, which `netlify.toml` says costs the Google Picker.
- **Why did geometry take 4,256 s here against 104.7 s in §0?** A 40×
  gap is not explained by "slower box". The two candidate differences are
  named in §8 (HTTP fetch + materialised source rather than an OPFS
  store-backed open, so no windowed provider and no `window=` in the report)
  and neither has been tested. If the resident-source path is genuinely
  *slower* than the windowed one, that inverts an assumption in
  `memory-residency.md`.
- **What does the tail of the 4 GiB budget actually do?** Nobody has driven
  a browser load into the wasm ceiling on purpose. `-s ABORTING_MALLOC=0`
  means a failed allocation returns null rather than aborting, so the first
  symptom is likely a nonsense pointer surfacing as one of #485's
  `Invalid typed array length` errors rather than an out-of-memory message.
  Worth knowing before a user finds it.
